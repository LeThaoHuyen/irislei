Hi there! My name is Huyen. I'm currently graduated from the University of Science, majoring in computer science, and I'm currently a AI resident at FPT AI Residency. My current research interests revolve around machine learning, specifically in multimodal deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and efficient machine learning. I thrive on engaging in intellectual discussions, whether with those who share my interests or individuals from entirely different backgrounds. To be part of such stimulating conversations, I dedicate myself to continuous learning and actively seek opportunities to connect with amazing people. 

Besides doing research in machine learning, I am also a tutor at Big O Coding- an algorithm teaching center in Vietnam. Here, I provide personalized one-on-one algorithm courses to anyone interested. Teaching, for me, is a rewarding exchange where I share my knowledge and, in turn, enhance my understanding through the interesting questions posed by my students.
